# Forum

A simple Forum on Asp.Net Mvc 5 with onion architecture that is being done with only practice and learning purposes.
Made with Asp.Net Core for the backend and pure HTML, SCSS, js and Razor pages for the frontend part. 
It was meant to be a forum but it is not finished yet. There are only “registration” and “sign-in” functions.
